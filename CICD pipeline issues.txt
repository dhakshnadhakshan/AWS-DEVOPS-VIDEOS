🔍 Here's a breakdown of common issues you may encounter in a CI/CD pipeline like yours:
🛠️ 1. Jenkins-Specific Issues
🔹 Plugin Issues

Jenkins plugins may become incompatible after updates.

Some plugins may break after Jenkins core upgrade.

🔹 Agent/Node Failures

Jenkins agents (slaves) might disconnect or fail.

Insufficient disk, memory, or CPU on agents.

🔹 Credential Issues

Expired or rotated credentials (e.g., GitHub tokens, DockerHub).

Misconfigured secrets in Jenkins.

🧬 2. GitHub Issues
🔹 Webhook Failures

Webhooks may fail if GitHub can’t reach Jenkins (e.g., firewall, network).

🔹 Branch/PR Conflicts

Developers pushing broken code or unresolved merge conflicts.

Missing merge protections or code review policies.

☕ 3. Maven Issues
🔹 Dependency Failures

Builds failing due to unavailable or corrupted Maven dependencies.

Repository outages (e.g., Maven Central or Nexus/Artifactory).

🔹 Build Performance

Slow builds due to heavy dependency trees or unoptimized Maven settings.

🧪 4. SonarQube Issues
🔹 Quality Gate Failures

Code not passing the SonarQube quality gate (e.g., low coverage, bugs, code smells).

Analysis step failing due to misconfiguration (e.g., sonar-project.properties).

🔹 Token Expiration

Authentication tokens expiring or revoked.

🐳 5. Docker Issues
🔹 Image Build Failures

Dockerfile misconfiguration.

Large or slow image builds.

Cache issues.

🔹 Registry Errors

Failed pushes to DockerHub/ECR due to rate limits or auth errors.

Image pull failures due to permission issues or tag mismatches.

☸️ 6. Kubernetes Issues
🔹 Deployment Failures

YAML misconfigurations (e.g., missing env vars, wrong ports).

Crashing pods (CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff).

Lack of resource limits or quotas causing scheduling failures.

🔹 Version Drift

Configs that worked before break after a K8s upgrade.

🔹 Ingress / Service Routing

Services not reachable due to bad ingress or service configuration.

📈 7. Prometheus/Grafana Monitoring Issues
🔹 Prometheus Scraping Failures

Targets not exposing /metrics or not reachable.

Service discovery misconfigurations.

🔹 Alerts Not Firing

Misconfigured alert rules.

Notification channels (Slack, Email) not set up or failing.

🔹 Grafana Dashboard Issues

Dashboards showing “No data” due to missing queries or misconfigured data sources.

🔐 8. Security and Secrets Management

Hardcoded secrets in pipeline files.

Expired or rotated secrets not updated in Jenkins or K8s.

Misconfigured RBAC in Kubernetes exposing too much.

🧩 9. Integration Points Break

Jenkins <-> GitHub webhook failure

Jenkins <-> SonarQube token issue

Jenkins <-> Docker registry auth failure

Jenkins <-> K8s API token expired or wrong permissions

⚠️ 10. Scalability and Performance Bottlenecks

Jenkins queue buildup due to long-running builds.

Resource contention on shared K8s clusters.

Prometheus hitting performance limits (cardinality issues, too many time series).

🧠 Tips to Mitigate These Issues:

✅ Use IaC (Infrastructure as Code) for K8s, Jenkins jobs, alerts.

✅ Set up monitoring & alerting for Jenkins, Prometheus, K8s.

✅ Use retry mechanisms and timeouts in Jenkins stages.

✅ Periodically rotate and test secrets.

✅ Maintain a CI/CD incident runbook.

✅ Use automated tests and linting before deployments.

✅ Regularly update plugins, images, and dependencies with care.
